The problems encountered in starting, growing and running a company have been encountered by thousands of people before. 

Fortunately dozens of successful CEOs and business leaders have written down their lessons learned in book form. These books teach us almost every important aspect of running a business and managing people. 

While there are hundreds of such books, the following are our favorites. Note that by some of the books, we have indicated they are *required reading* by all managers at Clearbit.
