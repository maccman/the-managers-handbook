So you've got your proposal approved and you’ve screened some candidates who are interested; you're making progress—great work! The next step is interviewing and evaluating candidates. The good news is that this is easier than [Sourcing](https://www.notion.so/Sourcing-94dbed2229444457a559058a4d374327) because it's a process that's entirely within your control.

As we explained in [Hiring 101](/hiring-and-onboarding/hiring-101), we have a standardized interview process at Clearbit to ensure consistency and rigor.

The five types of interviews are:

1. [Screening interviews](https://www.notion.so/Screening-interviews-4d779521af484ace8e5c208ea189e1db)
2. [Top-grading interviews](https://www.notion.so/Top-grading-interviews-dc5913c10f574b24a8de0a692fb8f5fb)
3. [Focused interviews](https://www.notion.so/Focused-interviews-3f22ff3c6dac4bc5ae33d92d9be88da9)
4. [Values interviews](https://www.notion.so/Values-interviews-1340c50239f54708a12bca8aefd126e6)
5. [Reference interviews](https://www.notion.so/Reference-interviews-22e7d8a4dec64f04be8590a979da541e)

Every candidate goes through all five types. Focused interviews and values interviews are best done in person onsite, and preferably back-to-back on the same day. The others (Screening, Top-grading) can be done prior to the onsite interview via Zoom/phone calls (to save time).

Our recruiting team will coordinate the day onsite, but it is your responsibility to determine who's going to interview the candidate and the different areas they should each cover. It's a waste of time (and boring for the candidate) if there's too much overlap in questions.

Fairly often, candidates won't be able to dedicate a full day onsite for interviews. In these cases, we'll split out interviews over two days.
